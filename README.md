# 📦 major_projects_data_analytics

Welcome to my repository of real-world, Python-powered data analytics and system simulation projects. This space captures my practical learning journey through code — each project here is built with logic, structure, and a mindset to solve real-world problems using Python and data.

## 🚀 About the Projects

This repository includes **three major hands-on projects**, developed using **Jupyter Notebook**, with a focus on **data handling, logic building, and user simulation**.

### 1. 🛒 Supermart Data Analytics (Vanshika Supermart)
A retail-based simulation where product sales, customer behavior, and inventory patterns are analyzed. The project demonstrates:
- Sales data tracking
- Basic inventory insights
- Pandas-based data operations
- Clean code structure for retail analysis

### 2. 🏧 ATM System Simulation (VP ATM)
A command-line based ATM emulator that captures the core functionalities of an ATM:
- PIN authentication
- Balance inquiry
- Cash withdrawal/deposit
- Error handling and input validation
This project focuses on logic building, conditional operations, and user flow.

### 3. 📚 Library Management System
Designed to manage books, members, and issue/return processes using OOP principles. This includes:
- Book cataloging
- Member record management
- Book issue and return features
- File handling for record persistence

## 🛠 Tech & Tools Used

- Python (Core)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- File Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception Handling

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Build real-time logic using Python
- Apply data analytics concepts practically
- Structure code in a readable and scalable manner
- Handle user interaction with validation and exceptions
- Use Python as both a scripting and problem-solving tool
